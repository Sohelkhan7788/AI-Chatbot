# 🤖 AI Chatbot – Flask NLP App

This is a simple AI-powered chatbot built using **Flask** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. It was developed as part of my Week 2 internship project at **The Codec Technology**.

The chatbot provides automated responses to user queries based on predefined intents using rule-based NLP.
